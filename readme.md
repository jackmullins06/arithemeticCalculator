# C++ Arithmetic Calculator

This program is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

## Installation
To use this program, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. If you do not have a C++ compiler installed, you can download and install one of the popular compilers such as gcc or clang.

To compile the program, you can use the following command:

```bash
  g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
```
